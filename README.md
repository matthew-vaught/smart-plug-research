# Smart Plug Energy Consumption Research ðŸ”Œ

This repository contains notebooks and supporting files for my research on **smart plug energy consumption** patterns across buildings on a college campus.

---

## Background & Motivation

This project investigates how energy usage varies across buildings and devices when measured at the plug level. The motivation was to:

- Understand how much power is consumed by devices connected through smart plugs.  
- Compare plug-level usage with total building loads to identify discrepancies.    
- Visualize consumption patterns across time (daily, weekly, seasonal) and geography.  

The ultimate goal is to highlight opportunities for more efficient energy use on campus.

## Data & Sources

- **Smart plug data**: ~1 million rows of timestamped plug-level power readings.  
- **Columns include**: timestamp, plug ID, power consumption (kW).  
- **Granularity**: data recorded at 1-minute and 15-minute intervals.  
- **Building-level data**: aggregated total load from building meters for correlation studies.  

---

## Methods & Tools

- **Data Cleaning & Aggregation**:  
  - Converted minute-level readings into hourly, daily, and weekly consumption trends.  
  - Filtered erroneous values and standardized timestamps.  

- **Visualization & Analysis**:  
  - Heatmaps, line charts, and animated plots to show seasonal and weekly patterns.  
  - Geospatial heatmaps across California buildings using H3 hex bins.  

- **Statistical Methods**:  
  - Pearson correlation between plug-level and building-level usage.
  - Peak load identification to study high-demand hours.

- **Tools**: Python â€” Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, H3, scikit-learn.

## Key Findings & Insights

- Plug-level consumption patterns clearly reflected **daily, weekly, and seasonal cycles**.  
- Strong correlations (but not perfect) between plug-level sums and building meter totals revealed how much of each buildingâ€™s consumption could be explained by monitored plugs.    
- Geospatial heatmaps provided a new perspective on how energy consumption changes across campus geography.
